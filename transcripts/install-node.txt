Node JS is a JavaScript runtime for building and running JavaScript-based applications on a server.

This short video demonstrates how to download, install and confirm the installation of Node on a local computer.

Begin by going to nodejs.org in your favorite browser.

Click "Downloads" in the navigation bar.

Find and click the option for your operating system to download the long term support (LTS) version.

Find the installer in your downloads folder and run it.

Follow the prompts until the installation completes.

Once done, open terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows).

Type node --version, press "Enter".

The version should match the installed node version.

That's it. Node is now installed.
