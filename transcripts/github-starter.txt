This short video will cover several important, but quick, items dealing with GitHub.

First, you will delete a repository (also commonly referred to as a "Repo").

Navigate to the repo to be deleted.

Locate the settings icon, and click it.

Scroll to the bottom and locate the "Danger Zone".

The last item should be "Delete this repository". 

Click the "Delete this repository" button.

You will be asked to type the full name of the repo and only after doing so, can you delete it.

Be aware that once deleted, the repository is gone and cannot be restored. Therefore, it is critical that you mean to delete it before doing so.

You will also have to provide your GitHub password to prove ownership. Only after doing so will the repository be deleted.

Next, you will use a template repository to create a new repository. It is necessary to be logged in to GitHub to do this.

In the course materials, find and click the link to open the template repository. 

If things are in order, the green button will read "Use this template". If not, log in to GitHub.

Click the green button and you will go through a series of steps which will result in you having a new repository in your own account.

When done, you can now clone the new repo to your own computer to begin working with it.
