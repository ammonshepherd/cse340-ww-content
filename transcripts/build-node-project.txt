To "build" an application is very much running a pnpm command and it does the rest.

Ensure that VS code is running and the working project folder is open within VS code.

There should be a package.json file present in the project. Remember that this file is a manifest of all packages that the project needs to operate.

Open the VS Code terminal. Type "pnpm install", then press Enter. Pnpm will build the application. You can see each step of the process in the terminal.

When an application is "built", pnpm will read the package.json file and install the packages listed in the package.json file into a "node_modules" folder, and will create a "pnpm-lock.yaml" file.

The contents of both of these new items should not be altered in any way at any time.

When done, you will edit the .gitignore file to list both items so that GIT will not track either and neither will be uploaded to a remote repository.

That's it. Building the application is very simple, but an absolute requirement for any Node-based project.
