PostgreSQL does not natively support the Enum (enumerated) data structure. It does, however, support the "Type" structure, which is equivelent. In this video, we will create a Type structure.

Open pgAdmin4 on your local computer and connect to your remote render.com database service.

Expand the server,  then the  database, then Schemas until you can see the "Types" item.

Right-click on "Types", and select "Create > Type...".

Click in the Name text box and provide the name of the type. We will use "account_type" (all lowercase and and an underscore, not a space).

Click the "Definition" item in the navigation bar.

Change the type to "Enumeration" using the dropdown arrow.

Click the plus sign three times and add "Client", "Employee", and "Admin" in the three text boxes.

If you click the "SQL" navigation item, you will see the SQL code that is being written by pgAdmin to create the type. 

If you are a student in the course, you will want to highlight, copy and save this SQL code as directed in the course materials.

Click the "Save" button to create the type.

In the database panel, on the left, you should be able to expand the "Types" item and now see the new "account_type" listed.

That's it. As you create new tables, you can use the type as a data source in a table.
